Lucide Icons has become the go-to icon library for React and Next.js developers in 2026. With over 1,400 icons, active maintenance, and first-class TypeScript support, it has replaced Feather Icons as the default choice for developers who want clean, consistent stroke-based icons.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Lucide Icons — from installation to advanced usage patterns.

## What is Lucide Icons?

Lucide is an open-source icon library forked from Feather Icons in 2020. The fork was created because Feather Icons stopped receiving updates, leaving developers with an aging library and hundreds of open issues with no responses.

Since the fork, Lucide has grown dramatically:

- From 287 icons (Feather) to 1,400+ icons
- From no TypeScript support to first-class TypeScript definitions
- From a single maintainer to a community of hundreds of contributors
- From stagnation to weekly releases with new icons and improvements

## Installing Lucide Icons

For React and Next.js projects, install the React package:
```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

For Vue projects:
```bash
npm install lucide-vue-next
```

For Svelte:
```bash
npm install lucide-svelte
```

## Basic Usage in React

Importing and using Lucide icons is straightforward:
```jsx
import { Home, Settings, User, Bell } from 'lucide-react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Home size={24} />
      <Settings size={24} />
      <User size={24} />
      <Bell size={24} />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

## Customizing Icons

Lucide icons accept four main props:

**size** — controls width and height (default: 24)
**color** — sets the stroke color (default: currentColor)
**strokeWidth** — controls line thickness (default: 2)
**className** — for Tailwind CSS or custom CSS classes
```jsx
import { Heart } from 'lucide-react'

// Large icon with custom color
<Heart size={48} color="#ef4444" />

// Thin icon for elegant UIs
<Heart size={24} strokeWidth={1} />

// With Tailwind CSS
<Heart className="h-6 w-6 text-red-500" />
```

## Using Lucide with Next.js App Router

Lucide Icons works perfectly with Next.js App Router in both Server and Client Components:
```jsx
// Server Component — works fine
import { ArrowRight } from 'lucide-react'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <a href="/docs">
      Read the docs <ArrowRight size={16} />
    </a>
  )
}
```

No special configuration is needed. Lucide components are pure SVG with no browser APIs, making them safe for server-side rendering.

## Tree Shaking — Why it Matters

One of Lucide's most important features is tree-shaking. This means your production build only includes the icons you actually import.

**Wrong — imports entire library:**
```jsx
import * as Icons from 'lucide-react'
```

**Correct — only imports what you use:**
```jsx
import { Home, User, Settings } from 'lucide-react'
```

With correct imports, each icon adds approximately 1kb to your bundle. Using 20 icons adds roughly 20kb — negligible for most applications.

## Lucide vs Feather Icons

If you are still using Feather Icons, migration to Lucide is straightforward. Most icons have identical names and the API is nearly identical:
```jsx
// Feather Icons (old)
import { Home } from 'react-feather'
<Home size={24} />

// Lucide Icons (new)
import { Home } from 'lucide-react'
<Home size={24} />
```

The main differences are that Lucide has 5x more icons and is actively maintained with regular updates.

## Conclusion

Lucide Icons is the best free icon library for React and Next.js projects in 2026. It combines design quality, developer experience, TypeScript support, and active maintenance in a way that no other free library matches.

For projects that need more icons, Tabler Icons is the best alternative. For projects in the Tailwind ecosystem, Heroicons is worth considering. But for most projects, Lucide is the default recommendation.
