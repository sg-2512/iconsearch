Extension session tokens are generated as high-entropy opaque values; the server stores only cryptographic hashes, while VS Code stores the token in SecretStorage and Figma stores it in clientStorage. Device approval links expire after a short period and connected sessions can be revoked. The website and APIs are served over HTTPS. No system can guarantee absolute security, but we use access controls and row-level security to reduce risk.'
