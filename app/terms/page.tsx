Founder eligibility is based on successful account verification and an atomic product claim, not download or installation counts. Founder access is personal, non-transferable, limited to one entitlement per user per product, and may be revoked for fraud, automated claiming, abuse, or material violation of these Terms. "Lifetime" means for as long as IconSearch continues to operate and support the applicable product; it does not guarantee perpetual availability of any specific feature.

Users who join after Founder capacity is reached may receive a free plan with different limits. We may change future free or paid plan features, but we will not convert valid Founder access into a recurring paid subscription.`,
