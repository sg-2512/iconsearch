  description: {
    intro: 'Iconify is the most comprehensive open-source icon ecosystem available in 2026. Rather than a single icon set, it is a unified framework that provides access to 294,000+ icons from 211 different open-source icon sets — Lucide, Material Symbols, Font Awesome, Tabler, Heroicons, Phosphor, Bootstrap Icons, Remix, and hundreds more — all through one consistent API and one import syntax.',
    detail: 'The defining architectural decision that separates Iconify from every other library is its on-demand loading model. Icons are not bundled into your application at build time. Instead, the @iconify/react component fetches icon data from Iconify\'s public API at runtime when it first encounters an icon name. This means you can use any of the 294,000+ icons with zero build-time cost — your bundle contains only the rendering engine, not the icon data. For production applications that need offline capability, Iconify also supports fully offline mode by pre-bundling specific icon sets as JSON data.',
    technical: 'The React package (@iconify/react) receives 605,000+ weekly npm downloads and works in React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, Angular, and vanilla HTML. Icon names follow a prefix:icon-name syntax — "lucide:home", "mdi:account", "heroicons:magnifying-glass". This unified naming system means you never need to look up library-specific naming conventions. TypeScript support is available. However, the runtime API-loading model means icons do not work in Next.js Server Components without switching to the offline/bundled mode, which requires additional setup.',
    verdict: 'Iconify is the right choice when icon variety is the top priority and you are comfortable with either the API-loading model or the offline setup. For projects that need access to hundreds of icon sets without installing multiple packages, it has no equal. For standard React/Next.js projects that need 50–200 icons from a consistent visual family, Lucide or Heroicons are more straightforward with better Server Component support out of the box.'

  faqs: [

      q: 'Does Iconify work in Next.js App Router Server Components?',
      a: 'Not in API mode. The default API-loading model requires browser JavaScript and cannot run in Server Components. For Next.js App Router, use offline mode: install @iconify-json/[prefix] packages for the sets you need, call addCollection() with the JSON data, and the icons will be served from your bundle with no API calls. This requires setup but makes Iconify work in any rendering context.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What is the difference between Iconify API mode and offline mode?',
      a: 'API mode: the @iconify/react component fetches icon SVG data from Iconify\'s public CDN on first render. Zero bundle cost, works immediately, but requires network access and browser JavaScript. Offline mode: you install @iconify-json/[prefix] packages (e.g. @iconify-json/lucide) and call addCollection() with the imported JSON. Icon data is bundled with your app — works in SSR, Server Components, and offline environments, but adds bundle weight.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Is Iconify free for commercial use?',
      a: 'The Iconify framework code is MIT licensed and free for commercial use. The individual icon sets retain their original licenses — most are MIT, Apache 2.0, or CC BY 4.0. Before using a specific icon set commercially, check its license on the icon-sets.iconify.design page. Clicking any icon set shows the license. The majority of popular sets (Lucide, Tabler, Heroicons, Bootstrap Icons) are MIT.'

    },
    {
      q: 'Should I use Iconify or react-icons?',
      a: 'Both aggregate multiple icon sets but work differently. react-icons bundles all icon data at build time (~81KB per sub-pack due to CommonJS). Iconify loads icon data on demand with a 15KB runtime cost in API mode. For bundle-sensitive projects, Iconify\'s API mode is more efficient. For offline/SSR use, react-icons\' @react-icons/all-files (ESM) is simpler to set up. Iconify covers significantly more icon sets (211 vs ~25) and has official Vue, Svelte, and SolidJS support.'
