    intro: "Radix Icons is a crisp set of 318 icons designed by the WorkOS team, the same team behind Radix UI — the headless component library that powers shadcn/ui and many other popular React component systems.",
    detail: "Unlike most icon libraries that target 24x24, Radix Icons are designed at 15x15. This makes them uniquely suited for dense interfaces where space is at a premium — data tables, toolbars, dropdowns, badges, and form controls all benefit from the smaller, more precise icons.",
    technical: "The @radix-ui/react-icons package provides fully typed React components for all 318 icons. All icons are tree-shakable and render as inline SVGs. They accept className props and work perfectly with Tailwind CSS. The library integrates seamlessly with Radix UI components and shadcn/ui.",
    verdict: "Radix Icons is a specialized tool — not a general-purpose icon library. If you are building with Radix UI or shadcn/ui, it is the natural companion. For general use, its 318 icons and 15x15 size constraint make it too limited. Pair it with Lucide Icons for broader coverage."

    { title: "15x15 only", detail: "The fixed 15x15 design means icons can look small or blurry if scaled up significantly. Not suitable as large decorative icons." },

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Is Radix Icons the same as Radix UI?",
      a: "No. Radix UI is a headless component library (buttons, dialogs, dropdowns etc). Radix Icons is a separate icon library by the same team. They pair well together but are independent packages."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to use Radix UI to use Radix Icons?",
      a: "No. Radix Icons can be used in any React project independently of Radix UI components."
    },
    {
      q: "Why are Radix Icons 15x15 instead of 24x24?",
      a: "The 15x15 grid was chosen to make icons sharp and precise at small sizes, which is where they are most commonly used — inside buttons, dropdowns, form fields, and toolbars."
    },
    {
      q: "Is Radix Icons free for commercial use?",
      a: "Yes. Radix Icons uses the MIT license which allows free use in any commercial project."
    },
    {
      q: "Should I use Radix Icons or Lucide Icons with shadcn/ui?",
      a: "shadcn/ui uses Radix Icons internally for its own components. For icons in your application content, Lucide Icons is the more common choice due to its larger icon set. Many shadcn/ui projects use both libraries together."
